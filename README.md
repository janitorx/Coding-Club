# Coding-Club
We aim to build a community of members of the University who would like to learn and share good software practices. We will meet for an hour each month, with two 30-minute topic slots to be delivered by staff and students from across the University, sharing their skills and knowledge related to coding. The talks may be introductory or more advanced and will include time for Q&A.

Our vision is that attendees will share good practice in analysing, visualising, storing and publishing research data and software. This is anticipated to be a community-run Coding Club, with coordination and admin support from the Advanced Research Computing Team (intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/bear), although we will be providing speakers for at least the first session to kick off the club.
